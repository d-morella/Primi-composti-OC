This is the project for the Game Theory course of my Master in Mathematics of Data Sciene at UNIPD.
The code solves a generic "Primi Composti" game, the 1 vs 1 version.
In order to be executed, the code needs to be in a Folder containing the sub-Folder "Report", where the results of the single game are saved as .txt files.
